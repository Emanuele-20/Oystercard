Write an RSpec test for the Oystercard class that will test that a
freshly initialized card has a balance of 0 by default, see it fail,
then write an implementation
(Oystercard class code) that will make the test pass.

Write a new test that checks that if a top_up method is invoked with
the top up value as the argument, the balance of the card
will increase by that amount.

Use test-driven development approach to update the
top_up method to raise an error if the action would
take the card beyond the limit.

When you completed the last challenge, you added the functionality to make sure a card can only be used to touch in if it has enough money for one journey. Now we need to actually charge the card on touch out.

Update the touch_out method to reduce the balance by minimum fare.
